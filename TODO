- remove isr_wrap stuff, this is more confusing than useful (too much c++ magic)

- implement compile-time sorting of reglist<> (by addr), which can produce speedup

- implement make_reg<> (analog to std::make_tuple<>, see register_manip.hpp for explanation!

- use regbits_type for RegisterBits (see arch/arm/cortex/stm32/f1/include/arch/reg/rtc.hpp)

- scb priority grouping
- nvic priority grouping
